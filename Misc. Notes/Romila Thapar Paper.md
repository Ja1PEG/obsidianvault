# [[Understanding India]]

### Changing Interpretations of Indian history
- European Interpretations:
	- Dominant European Ideologies
	- Doesn't sit right with ancient Indian traditions
	- Often Critical of India, but there are some nice historians too
	- Renaissance saw increased Indian Knowledge in Europe
	- Fantastical accounts of Indian History
- Indian Scholars influenced by European Ideologies
- Administrators who were historians heavily favoured the British rule
	- Developed the society better
	- Source Material fits biases
- Reliance on the caste system held us back:
	- Ancient-laws codified in present day reality
- Germans and French:
	- No influence from Administrators
		- Sympathy to Indian traditions
		- Explored Industrialization and Social Organization
	- Weber studied India separate from Contemporary European bases 
- British:
	- Vincent Smith:
		- British Raj ended Despotism
		- Focused on Ancient India only
		- Measured civilizations by using the Greek samples
		- New Evidence allowed for more insight
		- Indian antiques gained popularity
- Shift in Indian Historical Writing:
	- Focus shifted to Ancient history
		- R.G Bhandarkar
	- Followed British models on political and dynastic writing
	- Shift from oriental Despotism
	- Focus on study of social and economic history
- Compartmentalization:
	- Into several disciplines like art, philosophy, society and religion
	- Caste rarely incorporated
	- Sharp distinction in Hindu/Ancient and Muslim/Medieval periods
- Recognition that History can be best studied within a social science framework
- Intensive study of the agrarian system reveals changes in land ownership and property rules over centuries
	- Challenging the theory of Oriental Despotism.
- Current focus in Indian social history revolves around understanding the precise nature of social relationships in early Indian society.
- Literary source material presents challenges, prompting re-examination of texts based on contemporary understanding of the caste system (Varna).
	- Contextualization of castes into Indian History and research methods
- Reliance on objectivity

### Orientalism:
- Indologists and Orientalists
	- Due to increased trade and interaction in the East
	- Asiatic Society, 1784 to encourage research
	- East India Company became liaison
	- Sanskrit grew in popularity amongst academics
	- Literature emphasized virtues
### Sanskrit:
- Links to Sanskrit and European Languages
	- Common Heritage became a topic of study
	- Viewed as a lost aspect of European culture
	- Max Müller's perspective: Emphasis on passivity, meditation, reflection
- Indian Past associated with Village communities
### Aryans:	
 - Indian Aryans, being dominant and close relatives to Euros
	- Nobility associated with Aryans
	- Orientalist writings mention Arya Samaj

### Exaggeration:
- Improper contextualization of historical sources
- Brahminical biases in literature
	- Brahminical World-views (Weltanschauung)
- Reliance on Pandits for learning Sanskrit
	- Convenient but unreliable

### James Mill:
- "History of India" 1817:
	- Hindu Civilization, Muslim Civilization and British Period
	- Utilitarian view for categorizing:
		- On the grounds of societal progress contributions
		- Utilitarian principles in legislations would help
		- British could civilize India
- Critiqued Hindu Civilization (So did Evangelicals)
	- Thought Christianity would fix us
- Condemned Indian Society
	- Lacked concern for political values
	- Despotic and Tyrannical (Hypocritical)
- The acceptance of the three-period division of Indian History:
	- Hindu, Muslim and British became widely accepted
- Affected Nineteenth-Century Philosophies of history
- Views widely accepted on Ancient India

### Hegel:
- True history involved dialectical change and development
- Indian Society centred around villages
	- No concern for politics
- India's past allowed for despotic and tyrannical subjugation
	- Oriental Despotism 

### Asiatic Mode of Production:
- Properties:
	- No ownership of land 
	- Village economies with towns and military camps instead of commercial spots
	- Self-Sufficiency
	- Surplus extraction allowed for despotic system to flourish (State takes produce)
- Marx:
	- Developed the thesis on the same
	- Scarce information and unreliable
	- Biases from Mill's works

### Nationalism:
- Historians influenced by Nationalist Movement
	- Political and dynastic history continued, but interpretations were more in line with a nationalist motive
	- Glorification of Ancient India
- Use of Muller's writings to push away European opinions
- Aryan Culture → Stability
- Spiritual Quality vs Materialism from the west
- Political Unity and glory
- Non-Violence as our trademark
- Indian civilization on par with Greek
- Discovery of Arthashastra: Works on Political Economy
- A deep interest in Indian Political workings

### Hindu Identity:
- Gupta Period "Golden Age"
- Muslim invasions being the cause of all ills
- Sanskritization of Indian history
- Post-Independence period fostered right wing roots in nationalist writings
	- While some were Marxist influenced like D. D Kosambi
- Nationalist schools led to interest in regional and local histories: e.g.: Bengal, Maharashtra and the Peninsula

### Marxist Approach and Analytical Methods:
- Dialectical materialism and Marx's historical philosophy on Asian Marxists' historical interpretation
	- Study of interrelation of social and economic forces in determining historical events
- D. D Kosambi emphasized means of production as Key
- Questions about: 
	- Role of archaeology, technology, economy, religion and other unique variables in Indian traditions
- Re-Reading of source material and a fresh understanding

### Archaeology:
- Tangible material remains give a more accurate reconstruction of Society
	- Trade routes, tools, housing, city planning
- Aryans destroying Harappan Cities, New towns being discovered

- Periodization in Indian History:
	- Need to redefine periods in Indian history or reconsider the necessity of divisions altogether.
	- Traditional Hindu-Muslim-British periodization based on ruling dynasties and foreign invasions.
	- Change in terminology to Ancient-Medieval-Modern doesn't solve the problem if the basis remains the same.
- Challenges with Traditional Periodization:
	- Muslim conquests occurred at different times in various parts of India.
	- Arab, Turkish, Afghan conquests occurred in different centuries.
	- Southern India with alternating Hindu and Muslim dynasties doesn't fit this pattern.
- Alternative Basis for Periodization:
	- Suggests using significant social and economic changes as the basis for periodization.
	- Ancient period might end around the 8th century AD or earlier, as important changes didn't coincide solely with Muslim conquests.
- Historical Development Phases:
	- Realization that well-defined historical development phases aren't universally applicable to all societies.
	- Historians should seek phases of development within a specific society, allowing analytical comparison with other societies.
	- Calls for more precise definitions in historical formulations while acknowledging variability.
