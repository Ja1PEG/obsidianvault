# History of Education in India:
### Ancient Vedic Education Systems:
- Based around the ideals of:
	- Liberation
	- Control over the self
	"Education in India was very free from any external control like that of the state or Government... It was the king's duty of imparting knowledge without interference from any source whatsoever" ~ P. N. Prabhu

- Set-up as:
	- Gurukuls: Built up around the family of the teacher, Students were supposed to cater to the families
	- Parishads: Comparable to a college, Multiple Teachers
	- Sammelan: Educational Institutions where scholars gathered at one place for discussions upon invitation from the Kingpin

- Aimed to preach:
	- Religion:
	- Literature (Often Religious):
	- Brahminical Values:
	- Spiritual Knowledge:

### Education under the Mughals and the Sultanates:

#### The Sultanate:
Preached hate against Hindus, but had an admiration for education and knowledge
Islam began being taught in the Maktabs and Madrasas

	Makhtabs: Primary School Format, Teaching Ayats from the Quran, teach the Arabic and, Persian Script, Children's stories of Allah and Fakirs
	Madarsas: Upon completing primary education, moving up to Higher Education, Special emphasis to Religious teachings, studying Quran, Islamic Laws and History among other subjects much like modern colleges

All this comes from a strong appreciation and love for knowledge and their prior existence in a region with great influence from the west

Some emperors loved the idea of education and heavily encouraged things like literature, philosophy and the sciences but the ideas often remained exclusionary

"On the Muslim conquest of India, Sanskrit receded to the background and Persian became the Court Language of the Muslim rulers."

"These Madrasas supplied the state with recruits for posts of Muftis, Qazis and Muhtasibs"

	- Muftis: Muftis interpreted Islamic laws and provided legal opinions and verdicts

	- Qazi: Qazis, or law ministers, held the position of sadr us sadr during Akbar's reign and passed judgments in legal matters.

	 - Muhtasibs, also known as 'amil al-suq, were religious officers responsible for market regulation and ensuring fair trade

For the first time in the Indian Subcontinent, we saw a lot of patronage from the emperors towards the educational institutions established by them. Scholarships, Maktabs, Libraries and Madrasas 

This period is when we saw an emphasis on writing history, this Tendency was different from the tendency of Ancient India. It helped 

'Alim' and 'Fazi' as degrees of Religion and Logic Respectively

**Education of Hindus under this regime was often neglected, brought about a disbalanced development of Education**
