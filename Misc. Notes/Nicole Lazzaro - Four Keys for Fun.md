# [[Research Methodology 3]] 
The paper "Why we Play Games: Four keys to more emotion without story" looks at the rationale behind people playing games outside of enjoying the story. The research conducted by specialists discovered that people tend to enjoy playing games not so much for the game itself, but instead for the experiences associated with the act of gaming. The paper primarily looked at Video Games and took a certain number of Hardcore, Casual and Non-Gamers for their study.

To collect the opinions of non-players about gaming, they also interviewed 15 friends and family members of participants who were nearby during the observation sessions.

The roster for the kinds of games played ranged anywhere from casual and solo to competitive games which were more often than not multiplayer.

The researchers decided upon the criteria for setting up the 4 Keys to enjoyment on the grounds of: 
1. What players like about playing
2. Whether a game induces emotion without story
3. Emotions of a particular kind are in preexisting popular titles 
4. The emotions are supported by psychology theory

“each Key is a reason people play and is a mechanism for emotion in a different aspect of the Player Experience.” ([Lazzaro, 2004, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/NB9MGQ58)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LII7H9RC?page=3&annotation=XRSTMXER))

Some of the best selling games were observed to have at least 3 out of the 4 keys.

The 4 Keys that the research narrowed down on were:
1. Hard Fun - Difficult to Master, High Skill Ceiling, Competitive, Proving one's Worth
2. Easy Fun - Purely on the grounds of sheer excitement of experiencing game activities
3. Altered State - More in line with Escapist Behaviour, Change in the internal state of the player during and after play
4. People Factor -  Enjoyment based on playing with company, either alongside or against other players

When non-players were reviewed why people no longer play:
They risk "addiction" - Onset of bigger responsibilities leave no time to play


Fear - Threat of Harm or Failure
Surprise - Sudden change
Disgust - Self-Explanatory
Naches/Kvell - Pleasure or pride at the accomplishments of a child/mentee
Fiero - Triumph over adversity
Schadenfreude - Gloat over misfortune of a rival
Wonder - Over whelming improbability - Curious items amaze players at their unusualness


The Emotions during play - 
This “Hard Fun” frequently generates emotions and experiences of Frustration, and Fiero.
These Immersive game aspects are “Easy Fun” and generate emotions and experiences of Wonder, Awe, and Mystery. 
Altered State - These players play for internal sensations such as Excitement or Relief from their thoughts and feelings.
Cooperative - These players enjoy the emotions of Amusement, Schadenfreude, and Naches
