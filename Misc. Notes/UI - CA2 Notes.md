## ['Dead Certainties' and the Politics of Textbook Writing by Janaki Nair](https://www.jstor.org/stable/6c18c11a-e8c4-3259-850b-e85a47568799?searchText=Indian+History+books+NCERT&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DIndian%2BHistory%2Bbooks%2BNCERT&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A47b1c0d18b3e071cce0c4d0923a58404&seq=5)

- Politics of Retaliation that tackles textbook writing
- Disparity in the distribution of textbooks in regions based on the chosen board of education (CBSE, ICSE, State Board)
	- Both the revised and original versions of Karnataka Textbooks reveal a lack of inclusion of new work, neglect of 40 years of research in the fields of Social, Cultural and Economic histories
	- Old textbooks showcase an openness to other claims on the Indian past that emerged from outside traditional historiography
		- Almost a warmth towards controversial history
	- Nonetheless the new textbooks favour the construction of a national consciousness even in non-right wing controlled states

## Periodisation Old and New

- The text discusses the periodisation of history textbooks in India, both old and new. These textbooks are designed to cover India's early, medieval, and modern history, with a focus on the struggle for independence. 

- In the old textbooks, this periodisation implied that early India had minimal conflicts, conflicts increased with Muslim rulers, and British rule was marked by the freedom struggle. 

- The new textbooks maintain this periodisation without the value judgments, but still emphasize the modern period as a singular narrative of the freedom movement.

The emphasis shifts from putting forth a more accepted account of history into putting out a piece of work that idolises certain ideas that match the Ideologies put forth by the ruling parties 

### "The process of rewriting, when it is driven solely by the need to reap quick benefits from political regimes in power, invites only the embarrassment of being endlessly repeated"

## [Knowledge and the Politics of Education by Yemuna Sunny](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24481204)

-  **NEP** swaying right wing
- Knowledge plays a crucial role in legitimizing functions that have been used by status quoist political forces
	- The role of knowledge in contemporary education needs in-depth examination and debate to usher in a system that includes all those who are now marginalised

- Irrational Glorification of Indian traditional education were disturbing features of **National Curriculum Framework for School Education** (NCFSE)

- The primary struggle of "Accessibility" of education also takes up space that should be socially allocated to all equally. It disallows marginalised people to question and argue against the status quo the same way the privileged folks can.

"The intention of this article is not to polarise the ancient/traditional, the modern/postmodern, or the east/west. They do not help us to critically understand our internal social dynamics"

In a popular Story about a brahmin and a boatman, the former keeps telling the
boatman that his life is insignificant because he does not have knowledge of the Vedas.
When the boat reaches midstream, the boatman says how insignificant the brahmin's life would be if the boat were to sink. For, he does not know how to swim and would surely die. 

The Story is popular because it shows how Brahmins lack life skills, ridicules the brahmins lack of knowledge. It also reflects the deep bifurcation of knowledge in society. 

Knowledge can never be truly understood when it is stagnated in the material provided to the masses, unless it dynamically involves the past. To examine knowledge is to understand it as a dynamic process.

The writing Indian history has seen sharp contestations and negotiations. The perspective on
past fell largely into two categories - one the oriental and another that looked down on it as inferior to European history. 

Nationalist historians in India became defensive glorified and the Indian. But none Of these could critically examine the past and the role played by its social structures. This impasse was broken by several historians. D D Kosambi's writings marked a major path of reinterpretation, which was led by a passion that was not dogmatic, dismissive, or chauvinistic, and "could take a stand and tell a Story from the point Of view Of those who laboured, but did not count in a history detailing achievements" (Chakravarti 2006: xix). R S Sharma, D R Chanana, Romila Thapar, VV Jha, Uma Chakravarti, and others further contributed to shape the lens of reinterpretation.

- Only by considering non-dominant sources and perspectives, we can achieve true representation. 
	- The past does not shut down in time, but changes, and often continues into the present and the future.
- Knowledge continues to be reshaped, in a dominant way, for contemporary capitalist globalization

A news report says, "The ministry is planning to set up a committee to study the ancient Hindu Texts, Vedas, Upanishads and other Epics to select relevant material for teaching" (Deccan Chronicle, 7 June 2014).
	The ancient and traditional have a lot of connotations. If the aim is to legitimise the existence of status quo, one can simply codify only the dominant groups' beliefs.

In the early 2000, BJP led NDA brought out textbooks that glorified Hitler as a nationalist while ignoring the clod massacre of the Jews and other communities under his regime.
Or when the History textbooks "forgot" the inclusion of Nathuram Godse as MK Gandhi's assassin.
There was also a time the HRD Minister merged Women's Studies with the study of families further encouraging the idea that women's belong in the house and are responsible for the wellbeing of the family only.

In 2009, Gatade wrote on the "horrors of caste discrimination in Ashram schools, observing that - even after 60-plus years of independence and talk of affirmative action programmes, for the majority of SC-ST  boys and girls getting education still happens to be a game of hurdles"(2011: 302), and that "we are still far from fulfilling the of the Indian Constitution" (2011: 303). We have a long way to go towards an inclusive education that sees its role as literation from the traditional and modern practices Of social exclusion. role played by right.
wing politics on knowledge is at logged heads With the role played by knowledge in the
struggles of labouring people

## [Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40646212) 

- NCERT allowed all states to introduce local history as a component, in additional chapter within the textbooks
	- These chapters often did not jell with the rest of the text
- As a consequence, the English texts appeared as the bearer of a democratic, secular and nationalist vision, while the translated texts were inscribed with the marks of local cultures and particularistic visions.
	- The act of translation, as we know, is always an act of transculturation, If the national sought to homogenize, erasing the particular and the local in an effort to produce the trans-local, vernacularisation reinscribed the particular on to the homogenous national, producing a hybrid text which reflected a range of conflicting pressures within society.

Thapar's vision of the professionalized production of knowledge seemed to crumble as history books were burnt on the streets of Bihar and historians' efT1gies went up in flames on the parade grounds in Delhi.

- The textbooks of the 60s had two objectives:
	- They sought to decolonize the texts: Earlier texts often borrowed uncritically from officials like Vincent Smith and offered readings shaped by colonial stereotypes
	- Writing a decade after Independence and partition, the texts were shaped by the intellectual climate of the time, troubled by communal carnage.

In the 70s the textbooks became a target of persistent attacks. Secular Historians became labelled as anti-Hindu and keen on sanitizing Muslim wrongs.
