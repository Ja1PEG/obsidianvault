# [[Data Structures]] Lecture 1

### Learnings:
#### - Abstractions of more complex data structures
#### - Gauge Time Complexity and Accuracy of data
#### - Data Manipulation
#### - Choices around Execution Speeds, Space Complexity and how to maintain the data (Debugging and Scalability)

## Notes:

### Intro:
Data is a simple value and can also be called **field**
Data Items can be stored as group of data
Grouped Data can also have sub-groups
Grouped Data is called a **record**
Collection of several records is called a **File**
Each Entity has certain attributes to which value is assigned
A record in any file contains any one field which is a **Primary Key**

Data Structures are responsible for processing the data from any database
The data is often processed in the **RAM** (Therefore space complexity matters)
	Done due to the latency and speed of the RAM

### Structures:
Records classified into fixed and variable length data
The study of such data structures include the three following steps:
1. Logical or Mathematical Description of the Structure
2. Implementation of the structure on a computer
3. Quantitative analysis of the structure

### Classifications of DS:

[[DSA Flowchart.canvas|DSA Flowchart]] 

### Arrays:

Simplest Type of DS (Often Pre-Programmed in a Programming Language)
Can be linear or have N-Dimensional Arrays
Indices are represented by either () or []
N-th element can be put in the subscript of the array name while reading documentation or problem questions
