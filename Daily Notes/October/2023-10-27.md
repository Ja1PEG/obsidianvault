# [[Algorithms]] Heaps:

## Tree-Based Data Structure, often used to perform sorting operations and optimised search operations

Heapify: Parent/Root node is always the maximum

## How to remove a node:
```algorithm
copy last entry to root node
remove the bottom node
swap the largest node with the parent node (Heapify the Structure)
```

## How to add a node:
```algorithm
Add the desired entry to the last
Now perform heapify the input at each node
```

## Array Representation:
```algorithm
Level based copying of the data:
	Root is always 0th Index
	Left Child Gets stored first, then right at the same level
```

## Heap Sort:

```algorithm
Partition array into ordered and unordered segments
Convert Array to Heap 
Swap last node to root node
Start heapifying first and last untouched entry in the unsorted region of the array
```

### To Note:
	- if heapsize = n then leaf nodes range from n/2 to n-1
	- then internal nodes will range from 0 to (n/2)-1
	- So if there are 6 elements then
	- Internal nodes will range from 0 to 2 and leafs range from 3 to 5
