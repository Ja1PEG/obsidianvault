# [[Research Methodology 2]] Ipsita Gauri (Statistical Sampling)

## Survey Method:
Questioning on a topic or topics and then describing their responses

Survey Methodology typically obtains information about a number of different **variables** in which the researcher is interested and identifies the **relationship** between those variables.

### Why Surveys:
If the end goal is to identify and establish relationships between an individual's:
- Characteristics
- Preferences
- Opinions
- Beliefs

### Example:
- Social research
- Market research
- Health research
- Politics: Studying the demographic, Public Opinion
- Psychology

### Types of Surveys:
- Questionnaires
- Interviews
  
Can be both Qualitative and Quantitative
Chosen on the grounds of sample size, location and the focus of the research

**Hosting Platforms:**
- Mail: Census-like surveys
	- Low Response Rate
	- At risk of self-selection bias
- Online: Students, ease of use and reach, Limited to internet accessible locations only
	- Ease of analysis
	- Ensure Anonymity
	- Less control biases, but can introduce self-selection bias 
- In-Person: Not cost-effective but can reach remote areas
	- Can hinder research due to power dynamics

All hosting platforms can induce selection biases in order to better fit the sample frame

### While Designing the Survey:
- The type of questions
- The content of the questions
- The phrasing of the questions
- The ordering and layout of the survey

### Open-Ended vs Closed-Ended Questions:
- Flexibility vs Predetermination
	- Spectrum of answers vs Black and White
- Likert Scale (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree)
- Range of Options (Example: Age-Ranges)
- Multiple Choice Questions (Can hold multiple values)

#### Closed-Ended:
Best for quantitative research, provide numerical data that can be statistically analysed to find patterns, trends and correlations

#### Open-Ended Questions:
Best for Qualitative research. No Predetermination allows for a spectrum of responses
Common in Interviews but can be seen in questionnaires for follow-up questions

An interview is a conversation, that can be:
- Structured
- Semi-Structured
- Unstructured
