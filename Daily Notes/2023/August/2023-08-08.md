# [[Research Methodology 2]] Comparative Case Studies
## Comparative Case Studies:

### Definition:
An approach that uses in-depth investigation of one or more examples of a current social phenomenon utilizing a variety of sources of data.

A '**case**' can be an individual person an event or a social activity, group, organisation or Institution.

### Uses:
- Archival Research, Secondary research, interviews, personal experience
- Can add or be the basis of pre-existing theory
- Even if they are questioned or may not be based on truth, it may still be sense of

### Distinctive Features of #Case-Studies:
- Flexibility:
	- Can Involve a single case or multiple
- Variability:
	- Could be descriptive, Exploratory or Explanatory
- Key place in policy research

#### The Brown Humour Case:
- Specificity of the case
- Individualised instances expanding further
- Bottom-Up approach
- Anecdotal Evidence
  
### Evaluation:
- Frequently Exploratory in nature and are usually substantiated with other methods
- **In such instances the study may be viewed less as a means to generalise than piloting a study**
- In policy research, it's not necessary to have numerous cases in order to identify the negative impact of a phenomenon, policy or Programme

His approach underscores the importance of considering complex interactions between ideas, beliefs, and economic systems, thereby offering a nuanced understanding of how various elements shape societies and economies. This case exemplifies the power of comparative case studies in unraveling intricate relationships and contributing to the advancement of research methodologies."

### Grounded Theory:
Inductive Research: 
	Case Studies made a comeback 
	Instead of drawing out **hypotheses** like Scientific research, beginning with questions about a certain topic

### Comparative #Case-Studies
Same time Different Places
Providing effective tools to understanding policy and practice along three different axes of social scientific research, namely *horizontal (spaces), vertical (scalar), transversal (time)*.

- Better acceptance of and reliance on case-based methodology related with:
	- Policy research
	- Practice in context of globalization coupled with intention to better account for culture and context
	- Generates scholarship critical of power structures, sensitive to alterity and other ways of knowing

### Case Selection:
- Similarity
- Differences
- Typical or Representative cases
- Outlier cases
	- Unexpected
	- Extreme
- Influential or Emblematic (Landmark Legal Cases for Example)
