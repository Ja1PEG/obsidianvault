# [[Home/Finished Courses/Data Structures|Data Structures]] Linked Lists Remedial:

Stacks and queues can be implemented in both arrays and linked lists

The Head of any linked list is non-operational but it points towards the next element that holds value.
## Stacks:

### As an Array:
Start with an index 0, and it's a vertical climb upwards (LIFO)


## Linked List:
Person analogy:
People are holding each other's shoulders
The person understands who they are holding in front of them

The node not only holds value but also holds the address of the next node (therefore) linked to the next one
It can infinitely accommodate data
