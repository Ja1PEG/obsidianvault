# [[Research Methodology 2]] Qualitative Interviews:
## What and Why:

**It is a Conversation with a purpose**
It establishes a general direction for the conversation and pursues specific topics raised by the respondent. The respondent does most of the talking, usually.

## Investigative Journalistic Interviews:
### Categorized on the grounds of:
- Style of Questioning
- Visibility
- Power dynamics

#### Investigative Interview:

#### Celebrity Interview:
- **Deferential Questioning**, Interviewer aims to coax the celebrity into sharing their experiences
- **Highly Public**
- Definite Power Dynamic, **Interviewee holds most of the power**
  
#### Job Interview:
- **Challenging** at times, but also seeks to enable the interviewee to be showcase self effectively
- **Details of the interviews are not public**, but the existence of the same is
- **Skewed Power Dynamics**

#### Qualitative Research Interview:
- **Emphasizes open-ended, non-leading questions**, focuses on personal experiences and seeks to build Rapport with the interviewee
- **Highly Private and Confidential**, anonymity may be requested and often expected
- **Complicated relationship** between the Interviewer and Interviewee, Attempts can be made to accommodate the interviewee better

## Philosophical Assumptions:
Justification of the choice of methodology in relation to the purpose of or rationale for the research
	Brings up a host of issues that need to be dealt with

## Methods and Methodology:

### Methods:
Techniques or Procedures to collect and analyse the data.
### Methodology:
Relates to a process where the design of the research and choice of particular methods are made evident and the rationale is explained for the same

## Interpretive Research:
Ideographic: 
- Describing aspects of the social world by offering a detailed account of social settings, processes or relationships

Interpretivism perceives experience and understanding as seldom straightforward; People participate in an indeterminate **lifeworld**, often attaching different interpretations and meanings to seemingly similar 'facts' and events

### Willig Raised 3 questions that define the framework for elaborating on assumptions:
- What kinds of assumptions does the methodology make about the world?
- What kind of knowledge does the methodology aim to produce?
- How does the methodology conceptualize the role of the researcher in the research process?

## Ethics in Qualitative Interviews:
- **Informed consent**: Important to engage the interviewee in this process
- **Confidentiality**: Anonymity is not Confidentiality, But Confidentiality must be guaranteed often to the interviewee
- **Right to Withdraw**: Consent Can Be Withdrawn Whenever Required
- **Assessing Risk of Harm**: Safety of the researcher and the interviewee both should not be compromised. Convey to the interviewee about possible harm involved in the research 
- **Deception**: Sometimes required to get a more honest response, but usually a dishonest practice. Could be a part of the methodology to begin with. 
	- Usually while research around Illicit activities
	- When faced with Hostility
	- Or Undercover Field Work
- **Debriefing**: Full Disclosure towards the end of the Interview and providing additional resources post-interview 
- **Use of Incentives**: Introduces often biases due to the nature of the act, could also work in one's favour from time to time
	- Nature of the incentive should never overwhelm the interviewee in order for them to skew their response negatively
- **Limitations to the Researcher's Role**: Researcher can't introduce biases or modify the contents of the interview.  
- **Honesty and Integrity in the Research Process**: Includes Debriefing, Deception, Honesty to inclusion of details from the interview, no misrepresentation and mistreatment 

## The Interviewer:

**Steinar Kvale** offers two metaphors of interviewing: "Miner" or "Traveller" as the Interviewer
- The first model assumes the subject posses specific information and the interviewer's job is to dig it out
	- We already know the presence of information
- In the Second Model, the Interviewer "**Wanders through the landscape**" and enters into conversations with people encountered
	- Discover unexplored avenues

**John Lofland** and his colleagues suggest that researchers should adopt the role of "**Socially Acceptable Incompetent**" when interviewing.
	A **Naturalistic Investigator** by definition. They are ignorant and need to be taught, almost like a **Student**.

## The Interview Process:
1. Thematizing: Clarifying the purpose of the interviews and the concepts to be explored
2. Designing: Laying out the process through which you'll accomplish your purpose, including a consideration of the ethical dimension
3. Interviewing: Doing the actual interviews
4. Transcribing: Creating a written text of the interviews
# [[Object Oriented Programming]] Exception Handling:

## EXCEPTION HANDLING IN JAVA

A Java exception is an object that describes an exceptional condition (that is, error), that has occurred in a piece of code.
When an exceptional condition arises, an object representing that exception is created and thrown in the method that caused the error.
	•	That method may choose to accept it, or pass it on.
	•	Either way, through the program the exception is caught at some point and processed.
	•	Java exceptions should be raised when any of the fundamental errors are there in the program
	
**Exception handling = Error Handling**
There are user-defined exceptions too

**Java Exception handling is managed by 5 keywords:**
```java
try
catch
throw
throws
finally 
// Finally will get executed always at end of program, if no other exceptions occur, then also it will execute

```
