# [[Object Oriented Programming]] Exception Handling 3:

## Throw || Throws:


## The Try Catch Ladder:

You can set up a Try-Catch ladder with a linear hierarchy of Checking and Execution.

```java
public class yo{
	public static void  main(String[] Args){
		try{
			OperationOfChoice();
		}catch(ExceptionName1, e){
			System.out.println("You got error 1 with error message: "+e);
		}catch(ExceptionName2, e){
			System.out.println("You got error 2. with error message: "+e);
		}
	}
}
```

## Custom Exception Classes:

We can create our own Exceptions from the derived class Exception.

During the runtime, in the try clause, we can call a method from our Custom Exception Class passing an error message and other inputs along the line.

We can use the `new` keyword.

```java
class AgeException extends Exception{
	AgeException(String message){
		super(message);
	}
}

public class Main{
	public void checkAge (int Age) throws AgeException{
		if(age>18){
			throw new AgeException("ErrorMessage");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("Success Message")
		}
	}
	
	public Static void main(String[] args){
		...
		try{
			checkAge(25);
			checkAge(21);
		}catch(AgeException, e){
			System.out.println(e.getMessage());
		}
	}
}
```

# [[Research Methodology 2]] Qualitative Interviews:

## The Interview Process:
1. Thematizing: Clarifying the purpose of da thing
2. Designing: Laying out the process through which the purpose for da thing
3. Interviewing: Doing da thing
4. Transcribing; Writing down da Thing
5. Analysing: Finding meaning from da thing
6. Verifying: Checking Reliability of da thing
7. Reporting: Telling people about da thing

## Structured | Semi-Structured | In-Depth 

Predetermined order of the interview -> _Structured_
Eg: Survey Research

Following a guide to conduct the interview -> _Semi-Structured_
Eg: Surveys or Qualitative Studies

Uses a topic list but respondents' priorities influence the final range of questions -> _In-Depth_ or _Narrative_ or _Qualitative_
Eg: Qualitative Study

## What makes a good Interview:

### Rapport Establishment: 
Taking Proper Ethical Considerations (Can be considered Manipulative), Making the interviewee comfortable 

*"The Craft Consists in calibrating social distances without making the subject feel like an insect under the microscope"* Richard Sennet (2003)

Things to do:
- Eye Contact (Depends Case to Case)
- Making the appropriate non-verbal responses or prompts
- Following Up Points where appropriate (First pretend to listen)
- Not Interrupting (Sorry)
- Not introducing personal opinions or disagreeing (Fly on the Wall but communicative)
	- Can Disagree or point out fallacies upon the interviewee giving incorrect information that has already been established

### Conversation Skills: 
Create a Natural Conversation or Conduct it Robotically (Depends on the Interview) 
### Sensitivity:
Listen Attentively and Probe Appropriately -> Non-Judgementally

## Interview Environment:
Creating a comfortable environment for the interviewee is crucial for both, the purposes of an informative and accurate interview

- Choose a comfortable **distraction-free setting**
- Open with easy questions, off-topic, **Hot and Cold Questioning**
- **Explain in broad terms the goal of the research** and explain as if it's really important to the interviewee to get the information out
- **Ensure the understand the confidentiality agreement:
	- Allow "off the record" but be clear about its scope
- **Generating trust early on can be important:**
	- Self-Disclosure can be effective (About shared experiences or goals)
		- False Impressions are valid in some cases
	- Mutual Acquaintances 
	- Particularly important for sensitive topics

## Interview Questions:
- Start with general questions
- Ask Open questions
- Ask Neutral questions
- Use appropriate everyday vocabulary not jargon/field specific terminology
- Use concrete rather than abstract questions
- Avoid question that can be answered with "yes" or "no"
- Avoid Biasing responses
- Do not share your hypotheses (if applicable)
- Do not use emotional, loaded or biased language
- Be careful about your behaviour (Expressions, Jumping to take notes, etc.)

### Probes are standardized ways to get more depth and detail:
- Short and Simple to avoid breaking focus
	- For Continuation: "Then What Happened"
	- For Elaboration: "Can you give me an example"
	- For steering the conversation: "You mentioned that..."
	- Probes can be non-verbal as well 
- Try not to overuse them

### Also prepare to reframe questions:
- Minimise the damage caused by question
- If a question draws a blank stare, reframe to make it more concrete and tie it back to interviewee's prior comments
- If all else fails, move on and come back after (Don't push too often)

### Question Order is important:
- Maintain proper structure and issue logical transitions
- Start with generally and easy questions
- Hot and Cold approach
- End with a question allowing respondents to comment on any topic covered in the interview or on the interview itself

## Alternatives to Simple Questions:

**Keep a diary like set of notes for a specific time or event** -> Diary Questions
**Ask about specific landmark incidents that affected them** -> Critical Incidents
**Boundless Listing without a probe or prompt** -> Free Listing
**Order things given by the interviewer** -> Ranking

## Mode of Interview:
- Telephonic: Harder to establish, Typically Short
- Video:
- In-Person
