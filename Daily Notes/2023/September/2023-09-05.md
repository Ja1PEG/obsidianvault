# [[Research Methodology 2]] Hypothesis Testing:

##### A hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world. It should be testable, either by experiment observation

- It's customary to give a statement with a hypothesis

Upon establishing a hypothesis, one needs to:
1. Test it: By Trying to falsify it
2. Draw Meaningful results

Build Two Possible Hypothesis, The hypothesis we test is often called the **Null hypothesis**, which is denoted by *$h_o$*

The Hypothesis we believe in is called the **Alternate hypothesis**, denoted by $h_a$. 
We act on the Null Hypothesis without any biases actively trying to prove it.

```md
If we reject the null
The alternate must be true
```

#### Example of A Court Case:
As the defendant of the accused in order to prove his innocence, we must look for his guilt instead of looking for instances of innocence 

$${H_{a}= Innocence}$$
$${H_{o}= Guilt}$$
|                | Ho is true       | H1 is true       |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Accept $H_{o}$ | Correct Decision | Type II Error    |
| Reject $H_{o}$ | Type I Error     | Correct Decision | 

## How to choose null and alternate-Cost Matters:

| Null Hypothesis                   | Type I Error/False Positive                                                             | Type II Error/False Negative                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Person is not guilty of the crime | Person is judged as guilty when the person actually did not commit the crime            | Person is judged not guilty when they actually did commit the crime          |
| Cost Assessment                   | Social costs of sending an innocent person to prison and denying them personal freedoms | Risks of letting a guilty criminal roam the streets and commit future crimes |

## Alpha
The type I error significance level or rate level is the probability of refusing the null hypothesis given that it is true, It is represented by $\alpha$, and is also known as alpha level. Usually, the significance level or the probability of type I error is set to 5%, assuming that it is satisfactory to have a 5% probability of inaccurately rejecting the null hypothesis 

## Beta
The rate level of the type II error is represented by Beta and linked to the power of a test (which equals $1-{\beta}$

| Error Types  | When Ho is True                             | When Ho is False                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Don't Reject | Correct Decision Probability = 1 - $\alpha$ | Type II Error Probability = $\beta$        |
| Reject       | Type I Error Probability = $\alpha$         | Correct Decision Probability = 1 - $\beta$ |

If Z Score of the Rejection Critical Value lies between the Z Score of the Standard Normal Distribution we get a valid $H_o$ and we can reject
