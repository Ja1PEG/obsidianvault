# ShutterUp:

We held the Club Interaction in Room 306

## Anahita Deshpande:
- Used a presentation
- Worked a lot with Admin under ICE
- Creating and hosting a Series of pictures
	- Photo-Walks: Participation is an issue
- Picture Post: A collection of pictures being published

## Radhika:
- Background of photography due to family
- Gain Final Year Relevance
- Sharing work with each other and hold discussions
- Bring in workshops 
- Their engagement with their own Small Business brings better management and knowledge of how to ensure maximum engagement
	- Monthly/Weekly Contests: Source for Validation and Engagement

## Sheuli Question:
1.  Inactivity:
	**Anahita**: Not a performance based club, Will Instead try to Increase participation by having a publication like model
	
	**Radhika**: Try engaging the folks during peak college hours instead of choosing Saturdays or the break
	
2. How to keep the Hype Up:
	**Anahita**: Events need to be spaced out enough in order to not have interests from burning out (Not Consecutive Events)
	Making use of Remote Work
	Having Incentives for Participating
	
	**Radhika**: Having Incentives is a good idea 
	Using recognition for keeping engagement up

  Sheuli counter-question: Mention of the Community Meeting, Remote Work being discouraging
