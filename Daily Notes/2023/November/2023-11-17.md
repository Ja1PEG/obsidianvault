# [[Algorithms]] Analysis of Recursive algorithms

## For Factorial:
### Backwards Substitution
```c++{
int fact(int n){
	if n==0 
		return 0;
	else 
		return fact(n-1)*n;
}
```

Recursion can be represented by:
	$n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)\dots(1)$
	Where,
	$0! = 1$ and $1! = 1$

The Function is called till an arbitrary number n,
	$F(n) = F(n-1) + n$

The operation is multiplicative and thus,
	$M(n) = M(n-1) + 1$
	Since, for a factorial of 0 we don't perform any multiplication 
		$M(0)=0$

This can also be represented by,
	$M(n) = M(n-2) + 2$

This establishes the relationship:
	$M(n) = M(n-n)+n$

Thus, Time Complexity is:
	$O(n)$
