# [[Research Methodology 2]] Visual Analysis of Paintings

## Cindy Sherman:
	Untitled #205
### Observed Understanding
Colours: Changes in Colour of the skin
Body Lines: Bodysuit on top
Eyes: Voyeur, Breaking the 4th Wall
Accessories and Outfit: The band on the hand, headgear (The translucency of the cloth)

### Contextual Understanding
Medium of the Visuals: Chromogenic Colour Print

Implied Texture:
	The idea of texture challenges the medium: Paintings often do not make use of varying textures, it's smooth and rough in varying places (thus placing it as a photograph)

Above Facts -> Implied Texture is smooth where the focus of the image shifts (Eurocentric Ideas of Beauty)

The uncertainty becomes certain -> the image challenges ideas of portraiture, portrayal of the body and spectatorship (the idea of the voyeur and wanting to be looked at)

**Textual Analysis isn't just understanding what the author/creator meant, but instead looking into the layers of meanings that can be understood by looking at the text.**
