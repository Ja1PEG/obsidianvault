# [[Research Methodology 2]] Textual Analysis

Analysis of text
	Mainly in the fields of Media/Literature/Film
	But can be extended literally everywhere

	Describing, Interpreting and Dissecting the Text to make sense of it

Rather than looking at the world around self, instead look at the media produced by the world and derive meaning from them instead

## Textual Analysis is of a Qualitative Nature:
### Kinds of Textual Analysis:
#### Interpretive Textual Analysis
#### Text analysis
#### Closed Reading (Largely employed by literature majors): Forces you to slow down, Read multiple times and then understand

For any kind of RQ, there's no specific methodology that needs to be followed, it's our interpretation and choice.

### Example of Reality TV:

	Why Consume Reality TV?

One way to tackle this RQ is conduct surveys; netting us mainly quantitative-like data (Ordinal Data, not Cardinal)

Then comes Interviews:
	Conversations fetch data that is more descriptive, vast and could often contradict something like a survey

	Ananya Realest Bigg Boss enjoyer

Instead of only conducting interviews, or surveys, if we rather dive into the the actual consumption of the show and our interpretations of the same RQ we gather information that we wouldn't find out by just indulging in other kinds of methods

## Texts can be anything
Anything that can be interpreted, can be scrutinized as texts (Thus Media Texts).
	Conversations also produce meaning therefore can be understood like texts

Someone did a textual analysis of the Sony *Walkman*
