# [[Research Methodology 2]] Internal Procedures of Discourse:

**Forefront of discourse, we find commentary.**
	Every society has a major narrative that is reiterated

Commentary has two functions:
	- Allows for endless construction of new discourses
	- to say what was silently articulated

Discourse and commentary must say what has already been said and repeat what had never been said
