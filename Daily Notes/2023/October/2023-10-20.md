# [[Algorithms]] Greedy Algorithms:

Situational optimisation, not scalable dynamically to varying workloads.
	Useful for Optimisation Problems, but not the best means

Suppose a problem can be solved by a sequence of decisions. The greedy method has that **each decision is locally optimal. These locally optimal solutions will add up to a globally optimal solution**

It works in phases:
- You take the best you can get at that moment, without regard for future consequences

**Scheduling Problem**:
Assignment problems basically 

**Huffman Encoding:**
- Pick 2 smallest numbers to Combine
