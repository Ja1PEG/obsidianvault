# [[Algorithms]] Introduction:

Algorithm Design and Implementation:
- wrt Time and Space Complexity
- Efficacy and Scalability

Algorithm's job is to optimise the program according to the needs of the user
## Properties of Algorithms:
1. Input
2. Output
3. Definiteness: Specific and Unambiguous
4. Finiteness: After finite number of steps it should terminate
5. Effectiveness: Every step of algorithm should be feasible

## Design of Algorithms:
1. Understanding the problem (Identify Scope)
2. Decision making on grounds of:
	1. Device Compatibility and Capabilities
	2. Choice of either exact or approximate problem solving method
	3. Data structures
3. Specification of Algorithm
4. Algorithm Verification
5. Implementation 

## Algorithm Strategies:
- Brute Force
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming:
- Greedy Technique: Value-Based Analysis
- Back Tracking: Trial and Error
