# [[Object Oriented Programming]] Lecture 3:

### Conditional Statements:

#### if-else
Same as C or Python.
Even for elif cases

```
if(x > < == and or ){
	...
}

else{
	...
}
```

To input a single character the syntax is:
`char ch = sc.next().charAt(positionInt); //Using Scanner Object`

#### Switch Cases:
Same as C/C++.

```
switch(var){
	case 'value':
	{
		Statement;
		break;
	}
	default:
	{
		Statement;
		break;
	}
}
```
#### Looping:

For, While, Do While are all the same as C.

**For-Each** has a different approach;

```
int for_each_array[]={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
for (int element: for_each_array) {
            System.out.printf("For Each Loop Out: %d\n", element);
        }
```

### Arrays:
To Create empty arrays use:
```
int x[]=new int[sizeof];
String x[]=new String[sizeof];
```


# [[Meetings and Agendas]] Website Cell Dissolution:

Work under the team:

- Website Design Changes
- Working on Images and Media content
- Design of the Faculty Page (Content is with us)
- Other Several  (Research Page to be moved outside of the Community Drop-Down)
- 

Need to look at the work needed to be done in the immediate future to find out what kind of roles need to be sought after
Need at-least 2 designers, familiar with Figma


Myself as Head, Abhinav working under the Cell still under the Content Moderation and Updating process.

Abhinav works closely with Anushka Waghmare

# [[Research Methodology 2]] Lecture 3:

### What is Research:
Systematic and Methodologically rigorous collection, analysis and interpretation of data relating to a phenomenon or multiple phenomena.

A **Phenomenon** is an observable event
	Any event deserving of inquiry and investigation especially processes and events which are particularly unusual or of distinctive importance

Data Collection is not Research, Analysis its research.

The problem in research arises when it becomes to establish credibility for claims and that's when the need for it also arises.

### How does perspective affect our understanding of the world?

You can divide our world into:
	A *Social World* and *Natural World*
##### Social Worlds:
Constructs where Human Beings are the agents
##### Natural Worlds:
Humans are not the sole agents of the natural world, definitely contribute to it though. 
Humans don't have complete agency.

These worlds consist of many variables or factors that interact with each other

#### How does being social actors affect the way we perceive:
Human Beings have the sole authority over the decision making process
Example: Policies, Economics

### Methodology:
- RM is about establishing baseline for establishing credibility of claims
- Methodology is the school of though by which one conducts research
- Method: Employed by the researcher to conduct research
- Choice of methods is always about the nature of research question
- **Methods should not be equated with discipline.**

The choice of Methods are questions specific not discipline specific

### Ontology:
- "Study of Being"
- It is studying the nature of the objects that one is researching
- What can be studied. **TLDR: Study of Study**.

*What claims can a researcher make about reality and who can legitimise these claims?*

#### Two Broad and Contrasting positions:
- Objectivism that holds that there is an independent reality
- Interpretivism/Constructivism that assumes that reality is the product of social processes


#### Positivist Stance:
- Reality as being independent of the researcher
	- Reality is out there and needs to be discovered using scientific methodologies via law like generalisations/regularities
	- Researchers do not regard themselves as active variables and presume *detachment* from their research
	- Objective study
	- Single objective reality exists regardless of the researcher's Biases
- Controlled and Structural Approach in conducting research
- Identification of a clear research topic
- Constructing appropriate hypotheses
- Adopting a suitable Methodology

Great for generalisation instead of Individual responses, Great of Large-Scale Studies

#### Interpretivist Stance:
- Reality does not exist outside of the scope of people's agency
	- Reality as human Constructs
	- Reality through the process of meaning making and as socially constructed
	- Avoiding rigid structural frameworks and adopt more flexible and personal research structures
	- Receptive to capturing meanings in human interaction
	- Make sense of what is perceived as reality
	- Informants and Researchers are mutually interactive

**Universal Laws:
I'm fighting my demons (subir)**
### Epistemology:
- Attempt to understand what it is to know and why does it help the knower
- "Study of Knowledge" Itself
	- Concerned with different aspects of the scope, methods and validity of acquiring knowledge
- How can knowledge be acquired or formed
- Relationship between knower and known
- How do we know what we know?
	Source? Trust me bro

#### Positivist Stance:
- Organised method for combining deductive Logical
- Precise Empirical Observations of Individual behaviour
- To discover and confirm a set of probabilistic causal laws that can be used to predict general patterns of human activity
	- Process Tracing: Dhundh saale
- Empirical facts exist outside of personal ideas, they establish cause and effect relationships (Dependant on causation); Patterns of social reality are stable
- **Quantitative** terms how variables interact, they often develop and test these explanations by drawing data from the world
- Dependable knowledge is based on direct observation or manipulation of natural phenomena through empirical means

#### Interpretivist Stance:
- World as constructed, interpreted and experienced
- Through interactions with wider social systems
- Social systems as patterns being created out of evolving meaning systems that people generate as they socially interact
- No generalisations, but more individualised 



*No Specific binary of Positivists can't be subjective, or Interpretivists can't be Objective*
*Explanation vs Understanding (Not the true meaning in RM but general definitions)*
