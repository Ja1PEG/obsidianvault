# [[Root-Branch/Courses/Data Structures]] Lecture 1

### Course Outcomes:
#### - Abstractions of more complex data structures
#### - Gauge Time Complexity and Accuracy of data
#### - Data Manipulation
#### - Choices around Execution Speeds, Space Complexity and how to maintain the data (Debugging and Scalability)

## Notes:

### Intro:
Data is a simple value and can also be called **field**
Data Items can be stored as group of data
Grouped Data can also have sub-groups
Grouped Data is called a **record**
Collection of several records is called a **File**
Each Entity has certain attributes to which value is assigned
A record in any file contains any one field which is a **Primary Key**

Data Structures are responsible for processing the data from any database
The data is often processed in the **RAM** (Therefore space complexity matters)
	Done due to the latency and speed of the RAM

### Structures:
Records classified into fixed and variable length data
The study of such data structures include the three following steps:
1. Logical or Mathematical Description of the Structure
2. Implementation of the structure on a computer
3. Quantitative analysis of the structure

### Classifications of DS:

[[DSA Flowchart.canvas|DSA Flowchart]] 

### Arrays:

Simplest Type of DS (Often Pre-Programmed in a Programming Language)
Can be linear or have N-Dimensional Arrays
Indices are represented by either () or []
N-th element can be put in the subscript of the array name while reading documentation or problem questions

### Linked Lists

### Trees:

Hierarchical Relationship between various elements
_Rooted Tree Graphs_

Mathematical Computation done by the computer can also be represented via tree-mapping
Example: (2x+y)(a-7b)^3 can be broken into branches with several operations

### Stacks, Queues and Graphs

LIFO: Last In First Out (Stacks)
FILO: First In Last Out (Queues)

More complex operations can be studied via graphical means

### Data Structure Operations:
1. Traversal and Modifications
2. Search
3. Insertion
4. Deletion

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)

Mathematical Description of an object and the set of operations on the object

It is a model that can be used by any Web-Developer who is trying to build a Front-End Applications. 
They don't require any knowledge about any data that needs to be processed.
# [[Meetings and Agendas]] SSLA Film and SLF

## SLF Teaser:

Update Both Actual SIU (Left) and SSLA (Right/ Might not Slide) Logos at the beginning and the ending

SIU Logo at the beginning and then contact information for SSLA at the end

Take prominent speakers and take out the quick and short clips from them to create a rapid montage
Not more than a minute (30-40 Seconds Preferably)

Needs to be uploaded on the Website as Well as Social Media

## SSLA Film:

Parallel editing for slightly lower quality footage
Dynamic Zoom should be avoided *Preferably*

Re-Shoot the Common Area + Other Student Spaces within this week

Incorporate the SSLA Programme Structure in the Footage as Well

From the Admissions PPT:
- Vertical and Horizontal Expansion Slide
- Spectrum of the courses offered
	- Emphasis on Professional Courses like Media Studies and Business
	- Core-Courses Captioning (Marquee of sorts)
- Electives (Intersections) Slide
- Sciences at SSLA
- Community Outreach and Research
- Alumni Inclusion (ROI)
**No Pictures of Minors, Pictures from the Organisation's Website for COP works**

2 to 3 Minutes Maximum
1/3rd of the Video can have the Programme Structure Content

1. Fun 3rd Floor Activities
2. Programme Structure 
	1. Clubs and Cells towards the end
	2. 4 Pillars Slide
3. Start of Workshops/Seminars
4. Co-Curricular and Extra-Curricular
5. Ends with Farewell Cap Throwing
