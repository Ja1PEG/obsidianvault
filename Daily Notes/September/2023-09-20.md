# [[Object Oriented Programming]] Exception Handling 3:

## Throw || Throws:


## The Try Catch Ladder:

You can set up a Try-Catch ladder with a linear hierarchy of Checking and Execution.

```java
public class yo{
	public static void  main(String[] Args){
		try{
			OperationOfChoice();
		}catch(ExceptionName1, e){
			System.out.println("You got error 1 with error message: "+e);
		}catch(ExceptionName2, e){
			System.out.println("You got error 2. with error message: "+e);
		}
	}
}
```

## Custom Exception Classes:

We can create our own Exceptions from the derived class Exception.

During the runtime, in the try clause, we can call a method from our Custom Exception Class passing an error message and other inputs along the line.

We can use the `new` keyword.

```java
class AgeException extends Exception{
	AgeException(String message){
		super(message);
	}
}

public class Main{
	public void checkAge (int Age) throws AgeException{
		if(age>18){
			throw new AgeException("ErrorMessage");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("Success Message")
		}
	}
	
	public Static void main(String[] args){
		...
		try{
			checkAge(25);
			checkAge(21);
		}catch(AgeException, e){
			System.out.println(e.getMessage());
		}
	}
}
```

# [[Research Methodology 2]] Qualitative Interviews:

## The Interview Process:
1. Thematizing: Clarifying the purpose of da thing
2. Designing: Laying out the process through which the purpose for da thing
3. Interviewing: Doing da thing
4. Transcribing; Writing down da Thing
5. Analysing: Finding meaning from da thing
6. Verifying: Checking Reliability of da thing
7. Reporting: Telling people about da thing

## Structured | Semi-Structured | In-Depth 

Predetermined order of the interview -> _Structured_
Eg: Survey Research

Following a guide to conduct the interview -> _Semi-Structured_
Eg: Surveys or Qualitative Studies

Uses a topic list but respondents' priorities influence the final range of questions -> _In-Depth_ or _Narrative_ or _Qualitative_
Eg: Qualitative Study

## What makes a good Interview:

### Rapport Establishment: 
Taking Proper Ethical Considerations (Can be considered Manipulative), Making the interviewee comfortable 

*"The Craft Consists in calibrating social distances without making the subject feel like an insect under the microscope"* Richard Sennet (2003)

Things to do:
- Eye Contact (Depends Case to Case)
- Making the appropriate non-verbal responses or prompts
- Following Up Points where appropriate (First pretend to listen)
- Not Interrupting (Sorry)
- Not introducing personal opinions or disagreeing (Fly on the Wall but communicative)

### Conversation Skills: 
Create a Natural Conversation or Conduct it Robotically (Depends on the Interview) 




### Sensitivity:
Listen Attentively and Probe Appropriately -> Non-Judgementally
