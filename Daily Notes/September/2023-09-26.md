# [[Research Methodology 2]] Interpreting Data:

## Continuation of Last Class:
	Recap: Transcription is good for interviewer notes, not rewatching/listening a recording, reading is faster and more efficient, Good transcripts include great detail of tonal matter and non-verbal cues.

## Now We Move:
- The latter part of the interview design process is to interpret the data gathered during the interview
	- Making sense of information gathered
	- Observing patterns and consistent behaviour or speech
- Interpret as you collect

The researchers formulate their themes or codes differently from each other
	Many Researchers employ a third party consultant who can review in order to give an external opinion on the evaluation and interpretation
	**Gives Unbiased Clarity**
