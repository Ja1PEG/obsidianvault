# [[Research Methodology 2]] Ethnography:

Process of ethnographic research and the end result both can be called Ethnography

*"Understanding and Understanding that is not your own and making it understandable to someone else" ~ Geertz (CockFight Man)*

Earlier, Ethnographies were contrasted with and usually seen as complementary to ethnology, which referred to the historical and comparative analysis of Non-Western societies and cultures

Development of Ethnography has a messy history and definition that overlaps and borrows from:
**Anthropology-Sociology-Culture Studies**
Methodologies for conducting research

**Early ethnographies included all prior socio-cultural, geo-political, economical contexts but no one does that anymore because it's okay to sometimes to look at certain nuances of the individual/community**

Due to reinterpretation and recontextualizations of meanings and processes ethnography has a complex history. Part of it has to do with it's intermingling with various methodologies.

standard meaning and nor does this uncertainty undermine its value as a label
