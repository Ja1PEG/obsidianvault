# [[Research Methodology 2]] Mathematical Modelling:

#### A process that uses mathematics to represent, analyse, make predictions or otherwise provide insight into real-world phenomena
## Why Mathematical Modelling:
Establish Mathematical Relationships between several variables in order to work on any kind of Research Question

## Kinds of Mathematical Modelling:
- Linear Regression models
- Exponential Models
- Piece-Wise Models
- Modelling with Differential Equations

#### Schelling's Model of Segregation (Agent-Based Models: ABM)
**Agent-Based Model** that suggested inadvertent behaviour might also contribute to segregation

*Agent-based models are computer simulations to study the interactions between people, things, places and time. Agents are assigned attributes, and are programmed to interact with other agents and the Environment in a specific way. These interactions produce emergent effects that may differ from effects of individual agents

The model focuses on one singular rule and is not a true representation of the population

It shows that even when individuals or "agents" did not mind being surrounded by agents of different races/economic backgrounds they would still choose to segregate themselves from un-like agents over time.


## The process of Mathematical Modelling

![[Mathematical Modelling Process.canvas|Mathematical Modelling Process]]

**The process of building a model involves systematically "loading" dynamic aspects of the real world into a symbolic structure (maths) which can replicate this dynamic through changes in quantities.

 Abstractions:
# [[Object Oriented Programming]] Abstractions

*Process of hiding info from others*

Abstraction is a technique of hiding unnecessary details from the user. **The user is only given access to the details that are relevant.** 
	Vehicle operations or ATM operations are classic examples of abstractions in the real world How is ATM operations an example of abstraction

**Abstraction makes it easier for users to interact with complex systems**. 
	By hiding the unnecessary details, abstraction allows users to focus on the tasks that they need to perform. This makes systems more user-friendly and efficient.


##### TM operations are an example of abstraction because the user does not need to know the internal details of how the ATM works in order to use it. The user only needs to know the basic operations that the ATM can perform, such as cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, and money transfer. The user does not need to know about the hardware and software that make up the ATM, or the complex algorithms that are used to perform the operations


Here is an example of how abstraction works in an ATM: 
- When the user inserts their card into the ATM, the ATM reads the card's magnetic strip or chip to identify the user.
- The ATM then asks the user for their PIN.
- If the PIN is correct, the ATM allows the user to perform one of the available operations.
- If the PIN is incorrect, the ATM will deny access to the user.

The user does not need to know how the ATM reads the card, identifies the user, or verifies the PIN. The user only needs to know that they need to insert their card and enter their PIN in order to use the ATM.
## Abstract Classes

- To create abstract class just add ‘abstract’ keyword
- Abstract class – a class whose object cannot be created
- Uses – to avoid duplication

We can not create object of an abstract class and subclasses of an abstract class must override the unimplemented abstract method

## Abstract Methods

- Abstract methods – methods within an abstract class
    
- It is an unimplemented method
    
- Has no properties – only structure – has no body
    
- If another class is not inherited from the abs class – to use the method –m have to override the method
