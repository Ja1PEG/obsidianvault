# [[Understanding India]] Interpretation of Archaeological Artefacts and Sites

- Facts need to be uncovered to create an image of the past
	- Unlike a stone tool or animal bone, a community's organization can not be dug up
- Important Things to be taken into consideration:
	- Stratigraphy
	- Context of diagnostics or parallels
	- Circumstantial Evidence

## Stratigraphy Study of the Strata (Layers)
1. Level Layer Deposit and stratum describe the make-up of the excavated ground in terms of layers created either by people or nature
2. Archaeologists attempt to record and study these strata carefully
3. By studying their relationship it is possible to sequence the events on the site
4. Each successive layer was deposited sequentially on top of the other

# [[Object Oriented Programming]]: Interfaces

Interfaces only consist of **abstract properties and  methods** which are all incomplete
	Interfaces cannot be instantiated much like it's cousin abstraction

#### How to Implement:
```java
interface HelpMe{
	void asjldikjsal()
}

class meowMeow implements HelpME{
	void asjldikjsak(){
		System.out.print("Hello world");
	}
}
```

The **implement** keyword
