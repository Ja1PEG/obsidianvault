# [[Algorithms]] Graphs/MST

## Graph Theory:
$G(V,E) -> Graph\space({Vertices,}\space{Edges})$ 
Directed Graphs only have one direction, not bidirectional
Vertices Giving Nodes, and Edges being the pathways
## Different Applications of traversing a tree:
DFS/BFS -> Depth/Breadth First Search -> Stacks/Queues

## (Extra) Properties of a Minimum Spanning Tree:
- Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make it disconnected graph
- Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a loop
- If each edge has distinct weight, then there will be a unique MST
- A complete undirected graph can have $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees, where n denotes the number of nodes in the graph
- Every connected and undirected graph has at least 1 spanning tree
- Disconnected graph does not have any spanning tree
- From a complete graph, by removing max (E-N+1) edges we can create a spanning tree

## Prim's Algorithm:

Greedy Algorithm to create a MST:
1. Add any node to the MST (Arbitrary)
2. Find the lightest edge leading outside of the MST (Comparison over all connected vertices, for the lightest edge)
3. Add the destination node to the MST (Connected via the lightest Edge)
4. Repeat until complete

## Kruskal's Algorithm:

Greedy  Algorithm to create MST using Sorted Arc Costs:
1. Sort Edge list
2. Check if the lightest edge creates a cycle
3. If it does not create a cycle, add it
4. Repeat until MST is obtained

## Boruvka's Algorithm:

1. First make every node a tree
2. Find the lightest edge leading outside of the tree
3. Merge Trees together that are connected via these lightest edges
4. Repeat until MST is obtained
