# [[Quantitative Reasoning 2 -  Finance]] Share Instruments:

## Equity (Share Capital) instruments
	Only Incorporated Organisations have the rights to issue shares

Ordinary shares give rights to a share of the residual profits of the company and to the residual capital value if the company is wound up, together with voting rights and various other rights

The shareholders are the owners of the business, they have voting rights at meetings in proportion to the number of shares held.

Shareholders receive 'dividend' payments from the company's profit - not-mandatory - at discretion of directors

Irredeemable and low value holding

Shares are the lowest ranking form of finance - due to part ownership in the business - owners get paid last

Companies are not allowed to issue shares below the par value (Nominal Value - Purchase cost fixed for life)
	IPO - Can start lower than par value - 
	Happens on the primary market, after that it's all secondary market
	Company shares number of shares at the minimum face value - Market sets their purchase order and sales are sold in descending order of offer
	Lower limit can be set, the lowest price will be the fixed price for IPO and the remainder of the initial higher priced offering is returned
