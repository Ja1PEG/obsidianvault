# [[Quantitative Reasoning 2 -  Finance]] Capital:

## Sources of Capital:

**Long-Term Capital:**
	**Debt:** Risky manoeuvre, No Assets to put against loans, No history of Credit, High Interest Rates on personal loans - Companies can't look at Banks to be reliable 
	**Equity:** Giving up equity in one's organisation for funds (Investment) - Financial Market -  Different forms of Equity Investment/Financial Instruments
**Medium-Term Capital:**
**Short-Term Capital:**

Split into :
1. **Capital Market:** Long and Medium Term Funds are lent in the Capital Market
2. **Money Market:** Short-Term Funds are lent in the Money Market

**	**Money Market entails, Borrow Money on Day 1 and maybe return it back in a few weeks 
		**Short Term requirements for cash - raw material/machine costs:**
		Supposing that a company needs to produce a batch of clothes, to purchase raw material they require funds and they will borrow funds from the money market instruments, and upon seeing sales they can pay off the loans 

**Capital Market** deals with company/wealth building - due to it's longer maturity period, it can fuck over due to systematic and selective market changes or many other variables might come into play such as projects or public perception of the company

Liquidity is a key factor that hosts a barrier to entry to investment into longer-term assets - Liquidity refers to the act of conversion of financial assets into cash

The more the liquid an Instrument is the higher the returns - but weak relation between both

## Primary and Secondary Markets:

Capital Market - 
	equity
	debt
Money Market -
	bill market
	acceptance market
	call money/market

**Primary Market** - Company and Customers are involved in the transactions:
	Initial Public Offerings (IPO) - First Time Investment opportunity
**Secondary Market** - Any investment opportunities going forth from IPO is where investors buy and sell securities
	Most of the financial market consist of secondary market trades

**Why the need for a secondary market to begin with:** 
1. Allows for us to control the valuations based on real-world performance
2. Liquidity - Enables much greater liquidity than when only primary markets exist:
	1. Enables the company to get a much larger audience - A singular person might not want to invest large sums of money but allowing more people to invest allows for risk mitigation for both individual and the company
	2. All instruments do not have a strong secondary market -  Equity markets are the most strong secondary markets - bonds have a slightly lower level of secondary market activity - quality of market is inconsistent

Liquidity always needs to be concerned, might not be the top priority but it is certainly important

## Debt Instruments:
Company issues loan capital to raise money from investors. The company returns by paying the investor a stream of interest payments plus an eventual return on capital
Long-Term loan capital instruments are often referred to as **Bonds** and short-term instruments as **bills**.
The Loan capital can be seen listed on a stock exchange
	- **Bond/Debenture:** Company issuing loans from investors - The investor is entitled to see returns in the form of interest and eventual recouping of the principal invested (*Redemption Period*)
	- No connection between price and face value of a bond
	- Price is likely to be lower than face-value, Face-Value is often the redemption value of the bond (*Tells the customer how much the return will be to the investor*)

$FV=Rs\space100$ 
$CR=5\%\space pa$ 
$RV=Rs\space 105$
$RP = 5yrs$
$Price=95$

Each Year - â‚¹5 as coupon payment (Inflow)

Cash Flow - 
	Inflow (+ve) - income
	Outflow (-ve) - Outgo

**Yield of a bond:** Total rate of return (avg return per annul accounting for the RV)

# [[Big History]] Fifth Threshold:

Hydrogen and Helium - Products of the Big bang
Lithium (3) till Iron (26) - Sustainable atoms inside Stars (Stable state)
Heavier Elements - Products of Supernovas
Compounds - Seen on Planets and Form Planets too (Planets are collections of heavier molecules)

These Atoms have their own gravitation and dense masses have a lot of gravitational pull - Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the universe - Iron also brings about Magnetism and Magnetic Field
