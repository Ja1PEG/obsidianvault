# [[Quantitative Reasoning 2 -  Finance]]: Capital Instruments

## Variations:
Interest and redemption proceeds may be linked to an inflation index. these are "*index-linked*" bonds
Interest payments account for inflation and other VRI (Variable Rate Issues) can be set by MIBOR (The Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate)
**Stepped** increments on payments based on time passed

The Call and Pull Options exist in these bonds (allows for repayment to be done on-demand).
Safer for certain kinds of investors who want to protect their funds against constant erosion caused by phenomenon like inflation

"Sinking Fund" - Repayments made throughout the term of the loan
**Debenture** is a loan which are secured on some or all of the assets of the company:
	Mortgage Debenture (Fixed Rate) {Security here would be the assets}
	Floating charge Debenture
With an unsecured laon stock there is no specific security for the loan 
Subordinated or Junior debts come below senior debts

**Convertibles** are debt instruments that convert into another instrument at some point of time in their lives

Both the state and Union Government issue bonds, and are considered 'gilded' or gold standard bonds ~ As close to risk free

## Foreign Bond:
It is also possible to borrow in another country
Diversifying beyond geopolitical bounds
A foreign bond is a bond issued in a domestic market by a foreign entity in the domestic market's currency as a means of raising capital

	Masala - Indian Bonds
	Yankee - American Bonds
	Samurai - Japanese Bonds
	Kangaroo - Australian Bonds

## EuroBonds:
Bonds issued by non-resident and denominated in other than the currency of the country in which it is being places
Eg: Reliance Issuing Bonds in America ask for investment in non-domestic currency (could even be different from the currency which the company's origin country follows)

US Dollar is the dominant currency of denomination for Eurobonds
Bearer Bonds - not registered anywhere centrally only the owner has records, also can be anonymously held

The jurisdiction follows the local legislature from the issuing country

## Equity (Share Capital) instruments
Investors purchase - Part Ownership to the extent of the shares purchased - value fluctuates with the wealth base of the company
Shareholders are owners of the business and have voting rights at meetings in proportion to the number of shares held

Shareholders will also receive "dividend" payments made from a company's profits. Dividends are not  legal obligation but done at the discretion of the directors

Ordinary Shares are the lowest ranks of finance issued by companies. On a winding-up they will rank after all creditors of the company.
	They are almost always irredeemable and have a par or nominal value attached
