## Types of Keys:
**Super Keys:** An Attribute that uniquely identifies a tuple within a relation
**Primary Keys:** Unique and not repeated, used to identify the tuple uniquely 
**Candidate  Keys:** Can be a candidate to be a primary key, has the property of uniqueness and irreducability
**Composite Keys:** The key may be composed of more more than one attribute
**Foreign Keys:** A Primary key of another table, an attribute within one relation that matches the candidate key of some relation

## Integrity Rules:
1. Entity Integrity: Primary Key **CANNOT** be null
2. Referential Integrity: If a foreign key exists in a relation, either the foreign key value must match a candidate key value of some other tuple in its home relation or the foreign key values must be wholly null
