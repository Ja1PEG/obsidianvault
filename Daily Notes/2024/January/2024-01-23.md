# [[Machine Learning]]: Understanding Data

Observed values in any system form what we call data
Raw Data is just unprocessed observations
Datasets are made of Data Objects (Each Object represents an Entity)
## Types of Datasets:
Record:
	- Relational records
	- Data Matrix, like: numerical matrix, cross-tabulations
	- Document  Data: Text Documents: Frequency Vectors
	- Transaction Data
Graph/Network:
	- World Wide Web
	- Social or Information Networks
	- Molecular structures
Ordered:
	- Video Data: Sequence of Image
	- Temporal Data: Time-Series
	- Sequential Data: Transaction Sequences
	- Genetic Sequence data
Spatial Image and Multimedia:
	- Spatial Data
	- Image Data
	- Video Data

## Characteristics of Structured Data:
Dimensionality:
	- Curse of Dimensionality
Sparsity:
	- Only Presence Counts
Resolution:
	- Patterns depend on the scale
Distribution:
	- Centrality and Dispersion
