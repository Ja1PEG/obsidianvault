# [[Quantitative Reasoning 2 -  Finance]] Risk v Return:
## Risk vs Return:
Risk refers to the variability of possible returns:
	All high risk decisions must compensate heavy returns
	The firm must consider the expected return from a given investment with the risk associated with it

Methods for assessing risk:
	Study the variability via coefficient of variation
	Kurtosis number based on historical data

Risk is **qualitative** measure and can be assessed by **quantitative** means

$${Greater \space the \space Risk \space greater \space the \space Reward }$$

## Factors that indicate the risk:

	Quantum of money invested - Absolute profits depend on that
	Safeguards in place - Low and High Risk investments
	Reputation of the organisation
	Investment is competitive - Dividends get split between the shareholders; the 
	increase in new shareholders of a particular organisation might end up shrivelling 
	the returns for the preexisting shareholders 

Unrealistic Scenario: 

| Investment A | Investment B |
| ---- | ---- |
| High Returns | Low Returns |
| Low Risk | High Risk |

Investment A clearly the better option, but the shareholders interest in purchasing A would artificially deflate the price of the share due to the fixed returns that the organisation holds

## Risk Tolerance:
1. Systematic Risk: "Undiversifiable Risk", "Volatility", "Market Risk"
	1. Affects the whole market and not just particular stocks or industry
	2. Unpredictable and impossible to completely Avoid
	3. Affects the entirety of the portfolio
2. Specific Risk: Affects a singular company or group of companies that represent a sector of the stock Market
	1. Overall risk can be lowered by diversifying your investments
	2. One company need not determine the entirety of your portfolio's position

**What kinds of Investors:**
Risk Averse - A normal investor; Risk Avoidance based on expectations
Risk Seeking - Intraday, Actual Stock Brokers and Hedge Funds; High Stakes investment
Risk Neutral - Government like Organisations (Do not consider risk as a factor affecting investment choice for social welfare) (Rarely Works)

People with stable disposable incomes can afford to be risk seeking due to the very nature of their lifestyles and earning potential; Higher risk appetite

## Objectives of Financial Managers:
### Profit Maximisation:

	Implies that a firm produces maximum output for a given amount of Input
	Minimal input for producing a given Output
	Profit earning is the main aim of every business activity
	Cover investments and provide returns for growth
	Profit as a measure of Efficiency

Wealth produced by a company is the main measure of Successful Company in present time for most organisations. Not a lot of companies seek to maximise profit
$$Wealth \subset Profit$$

Why Maximise Profits:
	Ensures maximum welfare of all stakeholders
	Confidence of management for expansion
	Attracts investors
	Efficient indicator of funds
	Survival confidence

Why not Maximise Profits:
	Encourages unethical behaviour
	Ignores time value of money
	Doesn't consider risk
	Attracts competition
	Attracts unwarranted intervention from the Government
	Workers demand increased wages and salaries
	Customers may feel exploited
	Profit is vague and cannot be defined precisely

### Wealth Maximisation:

A shareholder is a part owner of a part of a company

The goal is to benefit all the stakeholders
Aims to maximise the shareholder's wealth
Net Worth matters most

## Differences between the objectives:

**Planning Duration** - Under profit maximisation the immediate increase in profits is paramount - Under wealth maximisation, management covers the discretionary expenditures like advertising, research and Maintenance

**Risk Management** - Profit max. min. expenditures to reduce risk profile, Risk Mitigation in wealth management

**Pricing Strategies** - When management wants to maximise profits, it prices products as high as possible in order to increase margins. A wealth-oriented company could do the reverse, electing to reduce prices in order to build market share over the long term

**Capacity Planning** - A profit-oriented business will spend just enough on its productive capacity to handle the existing sales level and perhaps the short-terms sales forecast. A wealth-oriented business will spend more on capacity to maintain long-term sales projections.

# [[Big History]] Biggest Bang:

Time begins with the big bang, and is relatively 13.7 Billion years before current day
Our specific focus begins about 200000 years ago ~ Earth, Solar System, Milky Way Galaxy
	$\Uparrow$
From the beginning of humankind

1-Dimension: Space (Nothing to Astronomical Units)
2-Dimensions: Time (Nothing to present day)
3-Dimensions: Origin @ 200,000 years ago on the time scale (Human Knowledge and History)

Visible Universe ~ Whatever amount of light has reached us thus far from the Origin

Why did the big bang happen?
No one knows, but what we do know is:

	Ingredients: Energy, Matter, Space, Time
	Goldilocks Condition: Uncertain (A Singularity)
	Emergent Properties: Hydrogen and Helium, Energy Flows, Gravity

## How do we know what happened?
1. Creation Myths, Folklore, Art - Across cultures
	1. How did it all start? A question in all religions - serves the purpose of showcasing might of any deity
	2. Nasdeeya Sukta - Vedic Hymn - Discusses why create the universe at all - Ends with nobody knowing the real reason and the creator being a construct more than reality
		1. Sort of scientific Approach - List all possibilities without prejudices and accepting 'not knowing'
	3. Bible - 7 Day Activity Report on how God created the world and handed it over to humans to care for
		1. Human-Centric Approach
2. Earth as the centre of the Universe - * changed to * Earth revolves around the sun
