# [[Machine Learning]] Another Intro Class:

## Key Terms:
**Attributes and Features:** Columns and Rows
**Classifiers**- Criterion that is required for to determine what kind of decision making will take place
**Conditional Probability** - If A then B probability cases can be used for supervised learning  

Machine Learning aims to:
	Improve Performance P
	at some task T
	with experience E
Can be referred to as a function consisting of these parameters <P,T,E>

## Kinds of ML:

1. Supervised learning - Labelled Data 
	1. Categorical Data / Regressive Cont. Data
2. Unsupervised learning - Unlabelled Data
	1. Self-Categorisation on grounds of Similarity
3. Reinforced Learning -  Experiential/Perceptual Policy Updation/Learning 
	1. Reward/Penalty Basis - For Games

|  | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Definition | Labelled Data | Unlabelled Data | Reward/Penalty |
| Type of Problems | Regression and Classification | Association and Clustering | Reward Based |
| Training | External Supervision | No Supervision | No Supervision |
| Approach | Map labelled input to know output | Understand patterns and discover output | Follow trial and error method |
| Popular Algorithms | Lin Reg, Log Reg, SVM, KNN, etc. | K-Means, C-Means, etc. | Q-Learning, SARSA, etc. |
# [[Research Methodology 3]] Lecture 2:

## Mathematical vs Scientific Proofs:
Nature of mathematical proofs requires one to start with a set of postulates and by reasoning derive the conclusion (Deductive Reasoning)

Scientific Knowledge is Experiment based learning

## The Knight's Tour Problem
Suggestions:
	What these kinds of puzzles can mean in context to mathematical exploration
	Recasting the problem as a mathematical problem
	Scope for analysis
	Methodology and methodological framework - Appears before the step of recasting (First Describe how you would turn this into a graph before calling it a graphical problem)
	Plan for execution
	Timeline of the research and Resource Allocation (Computation, etc.)

## Showing a plot of the film quantitatively
Possible Ideas:
	- Weighted by some kind of measure that changes temporally over the course of the media
	- What defines an edge
	- Structural Balance / Frustration in these networks (Unbalanced Networks, Number of Sign Changes)

1. Social Graph -  Interaction vs Friendship
	1. Undirected Graph
2. What represents the nodes and edges
3. What do we aim to understand from it

Looking at the relationships between characters from Pride and Prejudice by looking at a social graph. The graph would represent the plot by assigning certain characteristic to the edges between nodes that represent people.

Establish a friendship network representing relations between characters from Pride and Prejudice and assessing the progression by looking at the frustration index. Where each node represents characters from the book, the edges are only established when there is any form of direct interaction between any two individuals.
