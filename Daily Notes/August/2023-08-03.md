## Colonial Psychology
### Edward Said (1935-2003):
The Binary Dynamic of the East and the West
European colonial domination of the Orient

#### Orient and the Occident:
The East and the West
Also, the self (The West) and the other (The East) of the Geo-Political World

The other from the point of the self, the other is everything that the self is not.
In all cases, the orient is the opposite of the west.

Not just the orient being looked at from the self, but the colonial east also starts believing the narrative of being the other

The occident claims to have all knowledge of the East ( I know you better than yourself ) and then tries to define it:
	The east is being defined on the terms of the west/The image is being imposed on the east on the terms of the west.

##### Orientalism manifests itself in 3 ways:
1. As a way of thinking
2. As an academic discipline: Knowledge producing bodies, works are written with the same biases of the other and the self
3. As a Corporate Institution: Scholars become Institutions

**Marx** called Asiatic societies hydraulic societies, due to the very nature of their establishment around water bodies

**Napoleon's** campaign in Egypt was intercepted by the Brits. When he came to Egypt, he brought **scholars** amongst his army. 
Discovery of the Rosetta Stone (Reveals the Society of Egypt, Study called Egyptology)
Brits took over the Suez Canal later down the line, controlling seafare.

"We possess more knowledge about Egypt than Egypt itself, since we studies them" ~ Brits
