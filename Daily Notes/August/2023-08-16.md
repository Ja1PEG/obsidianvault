# [[Research Methodology 2]] Statistical Sampling

## Definition:
- A method that takes a sample subset from the population Drawing out inferences that can henceforth be applied on the entire population

## Benefits:
- Time Effective
- Cost Effective
## Key Concepts:
- Population: Entire group of interest
- Sample: Subset of population
- Sampling Frame: A list or representation of the entire population from which the sample will be drawn
- Sampling Method: The technique used to select the sample from the population
- Sampling Bias: When the sample does not accurately represent the population due to the method used or other factors

## Sampling Techniques:
### Simple Random Sampling:
- Every member of the population has an equal chance to be selected
- Impractical for larger population
- Achieves better representation but can also under-represent certain groups from the sample

### Stratified Sampling:
- Population divided into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics
- Random Samples taken from each subgroup
- Ensures representation for each subgroup
- Pseudorandom in Theory

### Systematic Sampling:
- A probability sampling method where researchers select members of the population at a regular interval
- Useful when sampling frame is available, but random selection is denied
- Pseudorandom in Theory

### Cluster Sampling:
- Population is divided into clusters based on geographical or other characteristics 
- Random sample of clusters is selected, and all individuals within the selected clusters are included in the sample
- Useful when a complete list of the population is not available

**Not to be confused with Stratified Sampling**
**Example: Census**
### Convenience Sampling:
- Selecting a sample that consists of readily available sample points
- Prone to selection bias and not always the best at representation

### Voluntary Response Sampling:
- Based on ease of access
- People voluntarily apply
- Prone to self-selection bias

### Purposive Sampling (Judgement Sampling):
- Non-random
- Researches uses their expertise to select a sample
- Need for clear Inclusion and Exclusion Bias
- Prone to observer bias

### Snowball Sampling (Boond Boond se sagar banta hai):
- Used to recruit participants via other Participants 
- Useful when population is hard to access
- Prone to issues with representation

## Advantages of Statistical Sampling:
- Cost Efficiency: Generalizing from accurate survey inferences
- Time Efficiency: Faster data collection due to reduced size
- Feasibility: The entire population is too large to survey, other times the study may be destructive in nature
- Precision: Sampling can also provide a high level of precision when done correctly

## Challenges of Statistical Sampling:
- Sampling Bias: Ensure the bias is minimal and sample is Representative
- Sampling Frame: Accurate and up-to-date representation of the population is crucial
- Sample Size: Balancing Accuracy with feasibility and resources (Find the Sweet Spot)
- Impossibility of Sampling: Deriving a representative sample is difficult, when the universe is too small or too heterogenous.

## Sampling Biases: 
Whether knowingly or unknowingly disproportionate representation due to non-random or non-responsive sampling
### Kinds of Biases:
#### Under-Coverage Bias: 
- Inadequate representation
#### Self-Selection Bias:
- People with specific characteristics are more likely to be represented in the sample than unsuccessful ones
#### Survivorship Bias:
- Successful observations, people and objects are more likely to be represented in the sample than unsuccessful ones 
- Hiding the negative ticks
#### Non-Response Bias: 
- People who refuse to participate or drop out from a study systematically differ from those who take part 
#### Recall Bias:
- Inability to recollect prior information with utmost accuracy can introduce such biases
#### Observer Bias: 
- Researchers influence the research 

### Sampling Errors:
The Difference between the sample statistic and the true population parameter. Can be measured, and are generally attributed to randomness in data

#### Non-Sampling Error:
Errors not related to the act of sampling, such as measurement errors, response bias, data entry mistakes, sampling bias, measurement error, non-response bias, sampling frame errors, etc.

The errors can be reduced by increasing the sample size. However, naturally there are constraints involved in doing so

*A statistical figure calculated for the population can be a Population Parameter, but for the sample is called Sample Statistic*

Directly comparing a Sample Statistic with a Population Parameter will usually not work out, unless the sample size is almost nearing the population's size.

*It's a lot like upscaling, generating data from nothingness is hard, but going top down is insanely easy until a certain point, at which it requires too much computation to get a 1:1 answer.*
