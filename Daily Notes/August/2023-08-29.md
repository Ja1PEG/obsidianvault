# [[Research Methodology 2]] Sampling Distributions:

## Standard Normal Distributions:
- Arriving to conclusions from the sample of a normal (99-95-68) distribution
- More the sample size closer we can go towards population tendencies 
- Choose a normal that can be fit into the population best, to derive the best conclusions
- The only way a normal distribution changes is by changing the mean (shifting the curve horizontally) and changing the SD (Changing the spread)
