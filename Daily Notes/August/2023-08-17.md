# [[Understanding India]] Psychology of Colonialism:

Process of Studying History - Creating an order
Past is an entity being studied (Object being studied, Ontology), History is the process of the study (Epistemology)

Studying the past in a chronological order creates the sensation of a relational history, it establishes a causal relationship (We see time in continuity)

Humanly impossible to study the entirety of history, therefore the segregation into clusters of kinds (which unknowingly creates an order of sorts)

## Why do we study history?
- History is studied with context to our present.
- It is also related to our identity. 
- To understand where we're going and our culture, it helps us to know our history and to make sense of things we do and believe in. 
- Substantiate discourse

### Ashis Nandy:
*"Colonialism is a psychological state"* The Intimate Enemy

Sovereignty mean there is no other higher power of governance
The Appellate System: Right to appeal to a higher court

First citizen of India is just Timothy Gupta

# [[Object Oriented Programming]] Static and Access Modifiers

## Static Keyword:
Acts like a pre-processor, holds the values in the memory immediately upon compilation and during runtime

If a method is initialized with the `static` Keyword, the `this` keyword will not work 

## Access Modifiers:

|             	| Class 	| Package 	| Subclass 	| World 	|
|:-----------:	|:-----:	|:-------:	|:--------:	|:-----:	|
|    Public   	|   X   	|    X    	|     X    	|   X   	|
|  Protected  	|   X   	|    X    	|     X    	|       	|
| No Modifier 	|   X   	|    X    	|          	|       	|
|   Private   	|   X   	|         	|          	|       	|

**Private** modifier values can only be accessed and operated upon using methods within the class.
