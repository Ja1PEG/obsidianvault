# [[Understanding India]] Psychology of Colonialism:

Process of Studying History - Creating an order
Past is an entity being studied (Object being studied, Ontology), History is the process of the study (Epistemology)

Studying the past in a chronological order creates the sensation of a relational history, it establishes a causal relationship (We see time in continuity)

Humanly impossible to study the entirety of history, therefore the segregation into clusters of kinds (which unknowingly creates an order of sorts)
