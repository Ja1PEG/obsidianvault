# [[Data Structures]] Queues:

Works on the **First in First Out** (FIFO) principle

**ADT** Operations on a Queue: 
- Enqueue
- Dequeue

We need to keep in check the **Front** and **Rear** nodes (ADT conventions)

## Algorithm for the ADT Operations using Arrays:

### Enqueue:
1. Check for Overflow (Rear should not be greater than Max_Size)
2. If front == -1 then assign front=0
3. Assign values to queue[Rear]
4. Rear++

### Dequeue:
1. Check for underflow (Front and Rear should not be -1)
2. Else ( if front == rear (i.e. 0) ) then reset Front and Rear to -1
3. Else Front++

### Display:
1. If front == rear == -1 then: Queue is empty
2. Else print from front to rear
