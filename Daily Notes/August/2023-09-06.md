# [[Research Methodology 2]] Mathematical Modelling:

#### A process that uses mathematics to represent, analyse, make predictions or otherwise provide insight into real-world phenomena
## Why Mathematical Modelling:
Establish Mathematical Relationships between several variables in order to work on any kind of Research Question

## Kinds of Mathematical Modelling:
- Linear Regression models
- Exponential Models
- Piece-Wise Models

#### Schelling's Model of Segregation (Agent-Based Models: ABM)
**Agent-Based Model** that suggested inadvertent behaviour might also contribute to segregation

*Agent-based models are computer simulations to study the interactions between people, things, places and time. Agents are assigned attributes, and are programmed to interact with other agents and the Environment in a specific way. These interactions produce emergent effects that may differ from effects of individual agents

The model focuses on one singular rule and is not a true representation of the population

It shows that even when individuals or "agents" did not mind being surrounded by agents of different races/economic backgrounds they would still choose to segregate themselves from un-like agents over time.


## The process of Mathematical Modelling

**The process of building a model involves systematically "loading" dynamic aspects of the real world into a symbolic structure (math) which can replicate this dynamic through changes in quantities.
