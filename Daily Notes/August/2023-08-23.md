# [[Research Methodology 2]]: Descriptive Statistics:
## Representation of Data:
- Moments of Data
	- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Mode, Median, Std. Dev and Variance
	- Measures of Dispersion
	- Skewness and Kurtosis
Moments describe any kind of data distributions

## Sampling Biases:
- Occurs when the sample is not representative of the  population due to systematic factors such as non-random sampling or non-response
	- Under coverage Bias: Inadequate Samples
	- Self-Selection Bias: People with certain characteristics have a higher chancel of self selection
	- Survivorship Bias:
	- Non-Response Bias:
	- Recall Bias: Inability to Recall
	- Observer Bias:

## Graphical Representation:
- Line Graphs: Continuous, trend analysis
- Bar Graphs: Quantity comparison
- Histograms: Interval based comparison for continuous ranges
- Line Plot: Frequency of data on a given number line
- Frequency Table: Tabular representation
- Circle Graph: Percentage
- Stem and Leaf Plot: Arranged Datasets
- Box and Whisker Plot: Spread and Median

#### Arithmetic Mean:
$${\sum^{n}_{i=0}xifi}$$
*Very susceptible to outliers* 
#### Geometric Mean:
$$\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}={\sqrt[{n}]{x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n}}}$$
#### Harmonic Mean: 
$$\frac{n}{âˆ‘1/x_i}$$
*Used for Varying Ratios while one quantity remains constant*

## Measures of Dispersion:
- Range 
- Mean Deviation
- Quartile Deviation
- Variance and Standard Deviation

### Relative Measures of Dispersion::
- Coefficient of Range
- Coefficient of Mean Deviation
- Coefficient of Quartile Deviation
- Coefficient of Variation
