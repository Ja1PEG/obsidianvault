# Class Notes and Meetings
This is my personal Obsidian vault that I use to take notes for my classes and meetings.

# Contents
The vault contains the following:

# Class notes
- Organized by semester and course in nested folders
- Notes are written in Obsidian Markdown format with backlinks to connect related concepts

## Meeting notes
- Folder for each group I meet with regularly (project teams, clubs, etc.)

# Named by group and dated by semester
- Captures objectives, action items, decisions etc.
# Usage
As this is my personal working notes system, the content is not neatly organized or formatted. The notes are optimized for my own finding and connecting information using Obsidian's bi-directional links.
